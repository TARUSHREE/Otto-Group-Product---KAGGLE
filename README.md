Otto Group Product Classification competition

Classify products into the correct category.
The Otto Group is one of the worldâ€Ÿs biggest e-commerce companies.Due to its diverse global infrastructure, 
many identical products get classified differently. Therefore, the quality of product analysis depends heavily on the
ability to accurately cluster similar products. 
For this competition, a dataset is provided with 93 features for more than 200,000 products. The
objective is to build a predictive model which is able to distinguish between the main product
categories.

  Data provided:
  trainData.csv - the training set
  testData.csv - the test set
  sampleSubmission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format

Attributes:
  id - an anonymous id unique to a product.
  feat_1, feat_2, ..., feat_93 - the various features of a product.
  target - the class of a product.(class label - 0 to 9)

Data Set Description: 
  Each row corresponds to a single product. There are a total of 93 numerical features, which represent
counts of different events. All features have been obfuscated and will not be defined any further.
There are nine categories for all products. Each target category represents one of our most important
product categories (like fashion, electronics, etc.). The products for the training and testing sets are
selected randomly.

# Implementation done using R (RStudio).
