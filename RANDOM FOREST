RANDOM FOREST GENERATION

Random forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks, that
operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is
the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. Random
forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set.
install.packages('randomForest')
# install randomForest package.
library(randomForest)
# include random forest library.
set.seed(12)
# set a unique seed number so as to get the same results everytime we run
the below model.
fit <- randomForest(as.factor(target) ~ ., data=train2, importance=TRUE, ntree=100)
# create a random forest model using the target field as the response and all 93 features as inputs
varImpPlot(fit) # create a dotchart of variable/feature importance as measured by a Random Forest
pred <- predict(fit,test,type="prob")
# use the random forest model to create a prediction
submit <- data.frame(id = test$id, pred)
write.csv(submit, file = "random_forest_submit.csv", row.names = FALSE)
