SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM)

SVMs use an implicit mapping Î¦ of the input data into a high-dimensional feature space defined by a
kernel function.
The svm() function in e1071 package in R is used.


install.packages('e1071')
# install SVM package
test2 <- test[,-1]
# removing the id column
attach(train2)
attach(test2)
library(e1071)
#include SVM library
model <- svm( train2$target~., train2 )
# train the data model with class named 'target'
res <- predict( model, test2 )
# predict the classification for test data
submit <- data.frame(id = test$id, target = res)
# create a data frame by re combining the result
with id column
write.csv(submit, file = "sub.csv", row.names = FALSE)
sub <- read.csv("C:/Users/sakshi/Desktop/project_sem6/data analysis/otto/sub.csv")
summary(model)
